pumped hydro retrofit limit = 0.5
down sampling clustering ? False
hierarchical clustering ? True
test run ? True
hydro development on ? True
autrarky on ? False
pump as continous variable ? True
emission limit on?  True
local gas price on? True
OBPS on? False
SMR and CCS technologies ? 50
