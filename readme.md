# Data processing projects
These data flow, management, post-process and visualization projects are donve for my PhD research tasks.

- **plan_oper_translator** converts outputs from the COPPER power system planning model model into inputs which can be read by the SILVER operational model.
- **demand_oper_translater** tool converts outputs from SILVER to building model and vice versa.
- **oper_process** tools are used to post-process and analyze outputs from the SILVER operational model.
- **test_flow_interpolation** was an interesting test project to interpolate power flow data outside of the models' boundaries.
- **vizualization** folder includes codes for producing plots to be used in my research projects.




## Usage Instructions
These tools are developed for specific uses and specific model outputs. They can be utilized for similar data structures, though. 
Copy required files into the cwd folder
Open terminal in this folder, then run desired.py files
